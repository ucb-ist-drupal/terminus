Feature: Listing a site's environments
  In order to administer my site
  As a user
  I need to be able to list all of its environments

  Background: I am authenticated and have a site named [[test_site_name]]
    Given I am authenticated
    And a site named "[[test_site_name]]"

  @vcr env-list.yml
  Scenario: Listing all environments belonging to a site
    When I run "[[executable]] env:list [[test_site_name]]"
    Then I should see a table with rows like:
    """
      ID
      Created
      Domain
      Connection Mode
      Locked
      Initialized
    """

  @vcr env-list-empty.yml
  Scenario: Listing all environments belonging to a site when none are returned
    When I run "[[executable]] env:list [[test_site_name]]"
    Then I should get the warning: "You have no environments."
    And I should see a table with rows like:
    """
      ID
      Created
      Domain
      Connection Mode
      Locked
      Initialized
    """
